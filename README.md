# Module-1-Challenge

These are the links to my module 1 assignment

For this Module there is a main Excel workbook with several sheets for all the data and a Word document that answers all the questions
 
  When creating new columns with additional data, I placed the columns near relevant columns so it would be accessible
  
  When finding the average donation per backer all the cells have the same formula except, H2 because I wanted to see how diferent formulas worked
