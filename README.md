# Module-1-Challenge
## Analysis of Crowdfunding Projects

The goal of this project is to analyze a vareity of campaigns from various crowdfunding organization in a variety of industries and countries. Excel was used, since visual representations and statistical analysis was required for the project. The Excel spreadsheet will show several graphs and Pivot Tables representing how the data interacts with each other. 

Please open the file through Excel and peruse the different tabs. There is a tab for the raw data, a Pivot Chart by parent category, a Pivot Chart by sub-category, a Pivot Chart by timing of campaigns, a graph of the success of the campaigns, and statsical analysis. 

Each of the sheets use different formulas or excel functions to analyze the data in the optimal way. When creating new columns with additional data, I placed the columns near relevant columns so it would be accessible
  
When finding the average donation per backer all the cells have the same formula except, H2 because it was interesting to explore different formulas. All the Pivot Charts were made from Pivot Tables and the other graphs are made from the corresponding charts. All questions about the data are answered in a corresponding Word document.

Hopefully, the data will be easy to understand with this analysis. One can get a better sense of crowdfunding campaigns from this sample of data.
